and associated Limited Building Setback Line as shown on the Plat, per the private agreement

other forms of building, grading, or impervious surface, within the east 25 feet of the west 75

enter upon said Landscape Zone only for the purpose of maintaining said fence and shall
restore the Landscape Zone to its condition prior to any disturbance from fence maintenance,
repair or reconstruction. Maintenance of said fence by said adjacent property owners does

continue in full force and effect and are hereby ratified by Declarant.
