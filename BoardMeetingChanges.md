# Changes noted by Board Meeting Notes

## Satellite dish

Repeated notes that satellite dish installation cannot be denied by HOA or the Commmittee,
so long as dish is placed in the least street visible location that still provides the
best reception.

See 2016-09-27 minutes, ACC Requests.

## Street Trees

The Board determined to reimburse Owners up to $300, should they have previously replaced
a street tree, due to the Board previously failing to recognize that the one street tree
per lot is part of the Association Landscape Plan.

See 2015-06-23 minutes, New Business, Street Trees.

## Fence Stain Color Options

The Board finalized an update to CCnRs, Art. XIII Building and Landscaping Restrictions,
Section 2 General Building and Landscaping Restrictions.  The options previously included
only a single choice.  The options were amended to now list the following three choices:

1. Kingston Clay (mix as noted)
2. Redwood, cedar tone matching pressure treated wood
3. Natural

The Kingston Clay mix contains the following:
* 3 gallons of Parker Prohide (product)
* Kingston Clay (color)
* 2 gallons of Parker Woodlite clear

## Unenforceable Provisions of CCnRs

The Board, based on community survey results, elected not to draft an amendment to
correct elements of the CCnRs that were deemed uneforceable.  See 2014-02-18 minutes,
section "Governing Document Amendment".  See also 2014-01-21 minutes, same section
title under "Unfinished Business".

These include notice from Brett Wiese (HOA attorney at Inslee, Best, Doezie & Ryder)
that the parking rules in the Montaine CCnRs are unenforceable as written, and that
an amendment must be drafted to make them enforceable.  See 2013-04-16 minutes,
section "Parking Rules & Regs."  See also 2012-08-28 minutes, section "Parking Rules".
See also 2012-02-21 minutes, section "Bike Park Sign".

## Tract AD -- Sammamish owns and must maintain

The HOA should yearly send notice to the City of Sammamish regarding the need for
landscape maintenance in Tract AD to help reduce the risk of adverse possession.
The HOA should arrange for service if the City does not respond with maintenance,
and then invoice the city.  See 2013-02-19 minutes, section "Stormwater Pond (Tract AD)".

## HOA Reserve Study (3 year cycle)

"Washington State RCW 64.38.070 requires as of Jan. 1, 2012 that all Homeowner
Associations are required to have a Reserve Study prepared by a reserve study
professional once every three years."  See 2012-05-15 minutes.
