more Owners are responsible for the existence of such liens, they shall be
jointly and severally liable for the cost of discharging it and any costs or
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title search
incurred by the Board by reason of such lien or liens. Such fees and costs

to such entry. Such entry must be made with as little inconvenience to the
Owners as practicable and any damage caused thereby shall be repaired by
the Board if the entry was due to an emergency (unless the emergency was
caused by the Owner of the Lot entered, in which case the cost shall be
specially assessed to the Lot). If the repairs or maintenance activities were
necessitated by the Owner's neglect of the Lot, the cost of such repair or
maintenance activity shall be specially assessed to that Lot. If the emergency
or the need for maintenance or repair was caused by another Owner of

Lot.
